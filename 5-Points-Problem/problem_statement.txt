The relationship between speed of sound in air and temperature is : v = 331m/s + (0.6m/s/C)Ã—T ; where T is the temperature in degree Celsius. Using a temperature sensor, 
determine the temperature of the room. Using the temperature determined, calculate the speed of sound in air using the appropriate sensor, and verify the percentage error 
in the value calculated through the formula, with value from the sensor. Also, print the result on the serial monitor.
